# Chat System

The backend hosted on the EC2 instance has exceeded the free tier usage limits, which has caused the site to go temporarily offline. We're working on resolving this migrating to a more scalable solution.

A clean, modular real-time chat MVP built with a modern stack. While chat apps are common, this project stands out for its code clarity, maintainability, and thoughtful architecture—showcasing my engineering skills.
